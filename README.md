# EDF-Visual-RAB-Editor
Hey there, I couldn't put too much time into this project as I've had a lot to do. I yoinked some of @kittopiacreator 's code for this project, so a lot of thanks goes to them. 

A few bugs are present, the worst one is when you try to open a .rab and cancel the action, it will crash completely..

On the plus you can almost import your own textures correctly(I've just had issues inserting the data). All viewed filed get exported automatically as you open .rab files. Yes this tool would've been awesome but sorry did not and do not have enough time to continue this. All my code is under MIT, but please check @kittopiacreator on gitlab.com for his licence.
